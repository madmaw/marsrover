# marsrover 

Android version of the marsrover problem (Google it) that I did for a job interview. 

I guess don't copy this code because it was the basis for me being rejected for the role. Feel free to review and tell me how terrible I am at programming in the bug tracker because, aside from the lack of testing (yes, I only wrote one), I really can't see anything wrong with it.
